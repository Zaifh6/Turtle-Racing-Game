## About The Project

The Turtle Racing Game is an exciting racing simulation built using Python's `turtle` graphics library. This project explores game development concepts and utilizes higher-order functions, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and event-driven programming to create a dynamic racing experience. Players control turtles in a race, navigating various tracks and competing for the fastest time.

### Features

- Real-time racing mechanics with smooth animations and responsive controls
- Graphical representation and user interactions managed through the `turtle` library
- Utilization of higher-order functions and OOP principles for a modular and maintainable codebase
- Different states of objects to manage game logic and turtle behaviors
- Event listeners to handle user input and game events
- A simple and intuitive interface for an immersive racing experience

### Built With

* **Python** – The programming language used to implement the core functionality and game logic.
* **Turtle** – The graphics library for creating the visual elements and handling user interactions.
* **Higher-Order Functions** – Employed to streamline game logic and event handling.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – For organizing code with classes and objects, enhancing code clarity and extensibility.
* **Event Listeners** – Used to manage user input and trigger game events dynamically.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The `turtle` library comes bundled with Python.
